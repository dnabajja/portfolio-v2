# Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?

Say what? But existing is basically all I do! But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! But existing is basically all I do!

__ decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up.__ *Uhhâ€¦ also, comes with double prize money.* Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.

## No! The cat shelter's on to me.

Say it in Russian! It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.

1. Ooh, name it after me!
2. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?
3. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things.

### Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?

Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Leela's gonna kill me. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!

* Large bet on myself in round one.
* But existing is basically all I do!
* No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!
