				**Since 2014,** Prescrip has set the mission of digitizing the medical prescriptions making it easy for the Doctors and the Medical Practitioners. Being present from the era of iPhone 6 and Nexus 6 (made by Motorola which was owned by Google), Prescrip's App has followed the Material Design System, which was still in its infancy at that time.
				
				With time Prescrip has evolved in to a Electronic Health Recorder (EHR), that helped Doctors and Medical Practitioners in recording patient details and investigations, look after the billing process and schedule appointments over the internet and it's available on the major platforms like Android, IOS and Web.

				> Prescrip is designed to enable you to print your prescriptions and maintain patient records with absolute ease(No Typing/No Writing Required). <br> - Apple App Store / Google Playstore

				## Let's Kick-off

				### Roles and Responsibility

				I acted as an User Interface Designer mainly and an User Experience Designer secondarily for the Android and IOS Application, also providing Motion Graphics Elements for the Interface. I gave my best efforts to evolve this product in every way to make it seamless and impactful experience.

				#### Roles and Responsibility
				Being an EHR, this widens the scope of competition. I glanced at various competitors' interfaces and scrolling through Behance, Dribbble, and checked on the analytics recorded by the previous app, to learn the trends and firm the goals, to move ahead.
