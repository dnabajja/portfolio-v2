## Concluding

### My Learnings

Working and coordinating directly with the client's team to figure out their thoughts and ideas and addressing them was a challenge, as words can be malleable. There was a necessity to align with their thoughts, cause this would be their upcoming identity and a crucial point of communication with their Audience, where the target would be lot varied than the initial plan. Hence, there needed to be a perfect balance of form and function was required as the targeted audience had a huge variation.

Creating an influence is not a short-term factor, as every step is evident by the World Wide Web.
