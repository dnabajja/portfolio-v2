**Anand Chulani, an international speaker, leadership and peak performance coach.** When his team wanted to expand their reach from the lanes of social media channels to an independent website, our team got into work. With a simple approach to be minimal and easy to transverse through the pages, making it easy for the users to connect with the team for Sessions and Events.

## Objective

The website was the primary medium of marketing of the upcoming Book Launch - Following that, Newsletter and Personality tests were to be added. This website was targeted to audience of ages 30 - 50 YO, this also required the website to be accessible and simple, while carrying a **fresh and spirited** approach.
