**Since 2014,** Prescrip has set the mission of digitizing the medical prescriptions making it easy for the Doctors and the Medical Practitioners. Being present from the era of iPhone 6 and Nexus 6 (made by Motorola which was owned by Google), Prescrip's App has followed the Material Design System, which was still in its infancy at that time.

With time Prescrip has evolved in to a Electronic Health Recorder (EHR), that helped Doctors and Medical Practitioners in recording patient details and investigations, look after the billing process and schedule appointments over the internet and it's available on the major platforms like Android, IOS and Web.

> Prescrip is designed to enable you to print your prescriptions and maintain patient records with absolute ease(No Typing/No Writing Required). - [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/prescrip-e-prescriptions-app/id1475105394) / [Google Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prescrip)

## Let's Kick-off

### Roles and Responsibility

I acted as an User Interface Designer mainly and an User Experience Designer secondarily for the Android and IOS Application, also providing Motion Graphics Elements for the Interface. I gave my best efforts to evolve this product in every way to make it seamless and impactful experience.

#### Research and Competitor Analysis

Being an EHR, this widens the scope of competition. I glanced at various competitors' interfaces and scrolling through Behance, Dribbble, and checked on the analytics recorded by the previous app, to learn the trends and firm the goals, to move ahead.

#### Building System

I created the basic Design System to established the principles of a clean and accessible Interface, along with Hi-Fidelity Prototypes to bring the vision into existence.

#### Coordination

Collaborated with the Business Analysists and with fellow designer colleagues to give this product a new identity and voice.

## From the Past

### Glancing the Insights

This was going to be the **third version update for Prescrip** and we very well knew that Doctors are a major part of the user base. The previous two versions had analytics built-in, which helped us a lot to **empathize, strategize and execute**.

## The Challenge

### Recognizing the Problems

#### It's Aging

As stated in the beginning, the app followed Material Design Principles in the initial phase, which has aged well with time. Similarly following the newer Design Principles might solve, but will surely age like the previous.

#### Bloated Journeys

A mindful revisit through the journeys, made us realize how bloated the paths were, hence taming the experience. Processes such as onboarding or appointment scheduling felt bloated due to excess of steps, which let-down the User, who just wants to get the job done.

#### Too Monotonous

Standard Blue colour - #008BE0, is what the app used in the Interface, leaving no traceable cues of progress, which again affected the journey feel like a never ending tunnel, filled with anticipation to see the light.

## Onto the Drawing Board

### Scribbling Ideas

#### **Establishing Patterns**

> Humans have a tendency to see patterns everywhere. That’s important when making decisions and judgments and acquiring knowledge; we tend to be uneasy with chaos and chance ― Thomas Gilovich, 1991.

We humans seek for patterns in every process we carry out, a simple task of writing prescription or diagnosing a patient there is fixed number of steps carried out and modified if needed, when viewed on a macrolevel a pattern seems to be formed.

Let's build a pattern in every journey we can, so once the user notices the wheel will never have to relearn every time. Adding in identifiable cues also makes usability easier on-the-go.

#### **Happy Onboarding**

*Cut the bloat and get the user onboard*, a crisper onboarding process ensures that user is not overwhelmed. Loads of information, chopped into smaller chunks, thus we brought the Tooltips, bite-sized information, related to the current screen.

Also rejoicing the User with words, not excessively, but tastefully, so things neither sound too technical nor too friendly, considering the audience base consists of professionals.

#### **Colour Cueing**

Using colours to provide visual cue, such as a Reddish Orange for the In-Clinic related features, similarly for applying this principle for other sections such as Billing and Video Consultation. This meant that the user is always aware where they are and what their actions affect to.

### Building Design System

Using a fresh range of colours to friendly curves and wide breathing space, being simple on eyes and to use. This system was the fundamental piece towards a consistent and coherent outcome during the collaboration. Some aspects like font have been reused from the previous version as they provided better accessibility, also reusing the older Blue accent colours too, but with some tweaks, so the existing users have touch with the brand.

### Usability Testing

Usability Testing is a core technique of User-Centric Design, this helps to evaluate the product by making it available to the users. After the designs were completed a beta build was made available through installable format and through alternative App Stores. These tests were handled by the higher level stakeholders through face to face meeting and via Google meets. The participants had the freedom to traverse the beta build. They appreciated the new interface and provided some valuable suggestions, those are as follows:

* The billing windows (billing list, billing receipt) need to be condensed, in order to provide more information on-the-go.
* Clinic Profile needed images and warnings like shifted, closed for renovation work, etc.
* The Notes feature was very handy and required at every stage.

### My Learnings

This project was a major challenge in my career. Working remotely while being in touch with the stakeholders, has though me a lot, over time. Learnt about the inner and outer working of Doctors, the challenges they faced in their daily lives regarding maintaining patient records. This project started as an Interface overhaul, but through the journey, UX was also taken care of. This app is a small piece of contribution towards making their lives a bit easier.
